Installation-Execution Tutorial for Carla Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (v0.8.4) on Linux

(Starting from a fresh install of Ubuntu v18.04)

1. Go to https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases, and download version 0.8.4, the compiled one. This is the latest version with compiled versions for both Linux and Windows.

2. Once the .tar.gz file is done downloading, open it with Archive Manager. 

3. Extract its contents into you directory of choice. I put extracted its contents into a directory that I made: ~/Carla  (for me, ~ is: /home/ericg/).

4. The Unreal engine has to be downloaded and installed. The Carla docs recommend downloading from the Unreal GitHub repository. To do so you have  to connect your GitHub account with your Unreal account since the Unreal engine is in a private repository. To link your Unreal and GitHub accounts: 
	a. Make a GitHub account if you don’t already have one
	b. Make an Unreal account if you don’t already have one
	c. On the Unreal website, go to your personal profile page. On the tabs on the left side, click on “CONNECTED ACCOUNTS.”
	d. Connect your GitHub account by clicking “CONNECT” and follow the instructions.
	e. You might receive an email within a couple of minutes of linking the two accounts from the Unreal GitHub account inviting you to join the developer group. Accept that. OTHERWISE, you should be ready for the next steps.

5. The actual downloading is done in the terminal and via “git” commands. If you don’t have git, in the Linux terminal, then get it by:
	a. sudo apt-get update 
	b. sudo apt-get upgrade 
	c. sudo apt-get install git
        (source: https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

6. Clone the Unreal (v4.18) git repository into the directory of your choice (my directory of choice is: ~/Unreal). Do so by:
        a. 'cd' into that directory of your choice
        b. git clone --depth=1 -b 4.18 https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git
        (source: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_build_on_linux/)

7. Install the tools & dependencies necessary for building the Unreal engine. Run these in the terminal:
        a. sudo apt-get install build-essential clang-3.9 git cmake ninja-build python3-requests python-dev tzdata sed curl wget unzip autoconf libtool
        b. sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/lib/llvm-3.9/bin/clang++ 100
        c. sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang cl
    (source: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_build_on_linux/

8. You are now ready to build the Unreal engine. In the terminal, 'cd' into the cloned directory. For me, that is: ~/Unreal/UnrealEngine. To build, run this one-line command:
        a. ./Setup.sh && ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh && make
        * NOTE: these '&&' separated three commands will probably take 1 to 2 hours
        (source: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_build_on_linux/)

10. Next, you need to install pip and then pip install the requisite Carla python modules.
        a. If you don't have pip installed, then: sudo apt install python-pip
        a. 'cd'  into ~/Carla/PythonClient
        b. pip install -r requirements.txt
        (source: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/stable/Docs/connecting_the_client.md)

11. That should be the last of the dependencies; you should be ready to run the simulation. Do so by:
        a. export UE4_ROOT=~/Unreal/UnrealEngine
        b. 'cd' into the Carla root directory
        c. Open 2 tabs in the terminal.
        d. In the first tab, run: ./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-server
            i. Use ALT+TAB to get back to the terminal after window pops open
        e. In the second tab, run your client python script. If this is your first time, then it is a good idea to just run the test script that comes with the simulation:
            i. 'cd' into ~/Carla/PythonClient
            ii. run: ./client_example.py --autopilot
        f. Get back to the simulation window; can use ALT+TAB
        (source: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/stable/Docs/connecting_the_client.md)

A window should have popped up with the simulation environment already running. Once the client example starts running on the extant server, the car should start driving itself shortly thereafter. If there are any problems, use the 'Issues' section on the carla-simulation/carla GitHub repository or just Google search it.
