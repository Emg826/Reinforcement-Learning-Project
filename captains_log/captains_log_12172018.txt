1233am. Tried some different things in cv2 including binarizing the image after a certain threshold, applying median blur and Gaussian blur, and doing canny edge detection. Most of  these were initially applied to the scene image, but eventually, I realized that depth images would greatly benefit from edge detection since white outlines on objects and white  blotches on near objects go hand in hand. So, now canny edge detection is included in airsim_env. An image can be seen on the README.md. This might make scene images a whole lot less useful, at least relative to depth planner images. I'm interested to see what this does.
