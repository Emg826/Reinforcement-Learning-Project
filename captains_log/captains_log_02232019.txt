1244pm. Ok, so for whatever reason, there was an issue loading the weights back into the DQN, so I couldn't see if any progress was made. Ugh. Also, the simulation had ground to a halt: 0.4 steps per simulation second! I thought that it might have been the map, so I downloaded Neighborhood and Coastline. Both of them crashed. Frustrated again, I've dropped the depth image from the inputs. I've doubled the neurons on the scene images and the ending recurrent layers, so I sure hope this helps. The network is now at 4M parameters.Oh, and by the way, I found an airsim function called simContinueForTime(), which may very well alleviate all of the slow down, or, hopefully at least, keep the number of seconds between steps constant.
