1037pm AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The proximity sensor didn't work (outputs the same exact value regardless of input), my code is garbage (I can't decouple the environment and the model and settings.md), nothing is working (ConvLSTM, CoordConv, regular Conv all failed to produce good results), training is taking fucking forever (getting through 1 second of simulation time takes about 2 seconds of IRL time), this is a lost cause (I am no closer to getting a car that can avoid obstacles than when I started). Back to banging my head against the wall like I have been doing since the beginning of this impossible project.

I guess the only thing that I can do at this point is radically simplify. I need to stack inputs. I need to be able to train faster. I am running out of time. I have <1 month until the code freeze. I have to try and salvage what I can.

Ok, so what should I do? I need to speed up training times. So how do I do it? Fuck going back and showing Dr. Fox the past stuff. I don't care about that. That's in the past and it didn't work. I am doing a redesign now, so what do I want to include? 

I'm getting rid of scene images. Those are fucking worthless it seems. I'm just going to feed the network 2 stitched-together depth images of the front of the vehicle. It won't be a 180 degree view, but it should be enough to not be completely fucking useless. I'll also use the coord conv layers, but I'll probably have to implement those manually in AirSimEnv since they don't work for 3D stacked inputs, which is what I also want to do. So 2 depth images, stack of 4-ish frames, 3 channels per image, let's go.
