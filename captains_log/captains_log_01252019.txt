132pm. Interesting stuff. So the car still can't make it to the other side of the roundabout, but there has been some learning. I saved a copy of the weights for later reference. I did think that maybe some of the progress was being obliterated between reinitializations of the sim and client since the lr was initially 0.01, so I've lowered it to 0.001. This should help the network hone in on the finer details. I'm going to move the car up, closer to the road of the roundabout because I also suspect that this task is still too difficult; the destination is too far away. Hopefully this will help. Oh, and the NN no loner outputs the same value for every input. This is probably the result of a combination of things: leaky relu rather than relu, getting rid of batch normalization, and fixing a coding error where the 4th scene conv layer instead of the 4th scene activation layer was flattened and then merged. Also interesting that the stack is only 2 frames w/ every 2nd frame being stacked. Still have yet to implement RNN w/ Conv3d, but that can wait. I want to chase down this lead. One more thing. I noticed that @ the start, the car wants to turn left, but turning left would result in the car going into the rocks and grass in that planter. This, I suspect, is the DQN confusing the starting sidewalk with the side walk on the roundabout. Not sure what to do about that just yet aside from moving the starting line up a bit. Almost forgot: i changed the offline weight update from 6k to 10k. That probably helped too.

803pm. ConvLSTM2D is working! WOOOOOOO! Not looking forward to explaining LSTM's, but maybe this will help? I sure hope so. Lot's of reshaping and stuff, but it finally compiles. However, the GPU ran out of memory when training the model, so I just made the initial layers have more neurons than the final layers; it slims down rather than fattens up. The shaping all seems to be correct, fortunately; it preserves temporality yet the conv is seemingly correctly flattened. I'll be interested to see how well this works.


844pm. So I had to chop off 1 convlstm layer for scene and depth each. Also, I had to reduce batch size from 32 to 6. Also had to reduce number of neurons per layer. Hopefully this is all worth it; I'm not too sure. Oh, by the way, init_sim calling the thing in CityEnviron/Binaries did not resolve the multiple-simulations issue.
