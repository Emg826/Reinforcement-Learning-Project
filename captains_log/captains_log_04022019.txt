1054am. So, the car regressed: it turns right too much, never corrects, like it's trying to take a shortcut directly to the end of the road. I'm not sure if it's the reduced learning rate or it if's the different gamma? In either case, I changed gamma and the learning rate back to 0.5 @ 6 time steps and lr=5e-3. Hopefully these parameters were alright, and it's just that the car need more time to train in order to make it around that 90 degree turn. Because otherwise, I don't know what to do. I guess I could try altering the reward function again, but given how unpredictable (for me at least) that is (e.g., car drove around in circles when reward by not colliding and distance travelled from last time step), I REALLY hesitate to do that. Maybe an idea will come to me. I don't know, but thank God for what's happened so far. 

1058am. Slight correction actually: the turn is a 180+ degree turn, not a 90 degree turn. Maybe if I tried a different, less curvy road I would see "better" results, though that does seem a bit deceitful, especially if I proclaim this progress.
