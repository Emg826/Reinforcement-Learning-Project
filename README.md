# Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository will be used for documenting my progress with building a self-driving car AI via reinforcement learning for my independent study project at the College of Wooster. The open source autonomous vehicle simulator, [Carla](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla "Carla's GitHub repository"), will be the environment in which the AI will be trained since the costs and risks of training and testing autonomous vehicles are each prohibitively high.
